# Web App

This is the main web app code. Below you'll find instructions on how to get
started with the project.

## Getting Started

### Installation

Since this project is part of a monorepo, dependencies are managed at the root
level. No additional installation is required here.

### Development

To start the development server, run:

```bash
yarn dev
```

This command will start the Next.js development server and open your app in your
default web browser.

### Building for Production

To build your Next.js app for production, run:

```bash
yarn build
```

### Running in Production Mode

Once you've built your app for production, you can start a production server by
running:

```bash
yarn start
```

This command will start a production server to serve your optimized app.
